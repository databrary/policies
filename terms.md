and/or additional terms and conditions will control. If you have
questions about our Websites, please contact us by email at
contact@databrary.org.

5. Rules and Conduct
--------------------

You agree not to use our Websites for any purpose or in any way that is
prohibited by these Terms and Conditions of Use.

You shall not (and shall not permit others) to either (a) take any
action or (b) deposit, download, post, submit or otherwise distribute or
facilitate distribution of any Content using any communications service
or other service available on or through Databrary, that:

-   Infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of
    publicity, right of privacy or other right of any other person or
    entity;
-   Is unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, libelous,
    deceptive, fraudulent, invasive of another's privacy, tortious,
    obscene, offensive, or profane;
-   Constitutes unauthorized or unsolicited advertising, junk or bulk
    e-mail ("spamming"); or
-   Contains software viruses or any other computer codes, files, or
    programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, limit or
    interfere with the proper function of any software, hardware, or
    telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized
    access to any system, data or other information of Databrary.

Additionally, you shall not:

-   Take any action that imposes or may impose (as determined by
    Databrary at its sole discretion) an unreasonable or
    disproportionately large load on Databrary (or its third party
    providers') infrastructure; for instance, users are expected to
    download reasonable amounts of data; excessive downloading that may
    compromise the functionality or integrity of Databrary will be
    investigated and may result in termination of access.
-   Interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of
    Databrary or any of its activities; or
-   Bypass any measures Databrary may use to prevent or restrict access
    to Databrary (or other accounts, computer systems or networks
    connected to Databrary).

You shall abide by all applicable local, state, national and
international laws and regulations.

6. Registration
---------------

As a condition to accessing non-public, Restricted Data on our Websites,
you will be required to register for an account using your name,
institutional email, and Institution, and then select a password. You
shall provide accurate, complete, and current registration information
(name, email, and institutional affiliation) and inform us in a timely
way when there is any change in your name or Institution. Failure to
provide accurate, complete, and current registration information or
inform us in a timely way about any changes in this information shall
constitute a breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use, which may
result in immediate termination of your account. You shall not use for
your registration the name of another person with the intent to
impersonate that person. You should only access Databrary using your
login information and should never use another user's account. You are
solely responsible for activity that occurs on your account; you shall
not allow anyone else to use your account, and you are responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You will immediately
notify Databrary by email to contact@databrary.org of any unauthorized
use of your account, or other account-related security breach of which
you become aware.

7. Institutional Authorization
------------------------------

Users who seek access to Databrary's Restricted Data must gain
authorization from an Institution or from an existing Authorized
Investigator (as an Affiliate). Seeking authorization is the final step
in the account creation and registration process. Databrary will work
with Users and their Institutions to secure a signed Databrary Access
Agreement with NYU. Authorization is granted when (i) an Institution and
a User affiliated with that Institution sign and return to us the
Databrary Access Agreement along with any required licensing fee, or
(ii) An Authorized Investigator grants a User access to our Websites as
an Affiliate. In signing the Databrary Access Agreement, the Institution
joins the Authorized Users in accepting these Terms and Conditions of
Use.

8. Your Representations and Warranties

16. Indemnification

expressly prohibited by law from indemnifying third parties. In cases
where an Authorized User's Institution is prohibited by law from
indemnifying third parties, the Institution agrees that it will be
responsible for the payment of claims, including for loss, personal
injury, death, property damage, or otherwise, arising out of any act or
omission of its employees or agents in connection with the performance

17. Dispute Resolution
----------------------

You and Databrary agree that any cause of action against arising out of
or related to Databrary or the Terms and Conditions of Use must commence
within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such
cause of action is permanently barred.

These Terms and Conditions of Use shall be governed by and interpreted
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (excluding the
conflict of laws rules thereof). All disputes under these Terms and
Conditions of Use will be resolved in the applicable state or federal
courts of competent jurisdiction located within the geographic
boundaries of the federal Southern District of New York. You consent to
the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any jurisdictional or venue
defenses otherwise available.

You expressly agree and understand that the remedy at law for any breach
by you of these Terms and Conditions of Use will be inadequate and that
damages flowing from such breach are not usually susceptible to being
measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, it is acknowledged that upon
your actual or threatened violation of any provision of these Terms and
Conditions of Use, Databrary shall be entitled to obtain from any court
of competent jurisdiction immediate preliminary and/or permanent
injunctive relief restraining any threatened or further violation.

18. Integration and Severability

communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic)
between us. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions of Use is
found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms and
Conditions of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
enforceable.

19. Miscellaneous
-----------------

These Terms and Conditions of Use are personal to you, and are not
assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior
written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights
and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint
venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Terms
and Conditions of Use and neither party has any authority of any kind to
bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce
rights under the Terms and Conditions of Use, the prevailing party will
be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. All notices under the

have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is
electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the
day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized
overnight delivery service. Databrary is an operating unit of NYU; as
such, all rights and obligations attributable to "Databrary" under these
Terms and Conditions of Use constitute rights and obligations of NYU.
