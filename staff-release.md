Databrary Staff Release Form
============================

Version Date: March 27, 2020

This form requests your release to share recordings of you collected
during the performance of your research duties in a secure, web-based
data library called Databrary (databrary.org). The library allows
authorized researchers to access shared videos, and potentially to use
carefully selected excerpts for scientific presentations and/or
informational and educational purposes (based on the level of release
given by participants). Authorized researchers will use professional
judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which excerpts and
images to present and with which audiences.

Signature of lab member:
------------------------

I give permission to share with Databrary any videos where I am recorded
in the performance of my research duties. Authorized researchers may use
the material for research purposes.

In addition, I give permission for authorized researchers to show
selected excerpts from shared research videos in public settings for
informational or educational purposes. I understand that researchers may
use the excerpts in presentations. I also understand that at times these
presentations may be videotaped or recorded and made available to the
public via the internet (e.g., YouTube). In giving my permission, I
trust that authorized researchers will use their professional judgment
and uphold ethical principles in determining which excerpts and images
to present and with which audiences.
