## Definitions of Suggested Fields 

The following describes information we would like you to include with the video files you plan to share in Databrary. You can use the attached Excel spreadsheet for managing these data (note headings in red have drop-down menus). We are happy to help you to personalize the spreadsheet for your lab use. If you do not provide information for a field, we will leave the field blank in Databrary, unless otherwise noted as a default. If you add fields to the drop-down menus or add columns, we will include that information in Databrary. Columns that are not marked “must have” are desired but not mandatory for including data in Databrary.

### Information we collect about the session

A session refers to a single visit or observation period. Participants may be observed at multiple sessions (e.g., longitudinal studies) and you should provide information for each session. Multiple participants may be observed at a single session (e.g., two siblings observed playing together) and you should provide information for each participant.

See the session tab on the Excel spreadsheet. Each row represents a single session. You can add more than one participant for each session. Information for the columns marked in red comes from the information under the predefined or participant tabs (see below).

### dataset - must have
* Use descriptive, non-idiosyncratic words to name the dataset.

### test date - must have 
 *  YYYY/MM/DD

### subject ID
* If you identify participants as distinct entities, then you should include their subject ID. List each participant in a single session with a non-identifying subject ID (does not contain participant’s name, initials, birthdate) that is unique from all other subject IDs for that dataset. You can add more than one subject ID in this field if there were more than one participants in a single session. 

### session ID
* If you have multiple participants in a single session (e.g., many children in a classroom, siblings observed together), signify that the participants were in the same session with a session ID.
 
### release level - must have
* Every session must be tagged with a release level. If you have more than one release level for multiple participants or for multiple people visible on the videos, we will default to the lowest level of release (e.g., if one person says private and another says shared, we will default to shared).
	* private - The participant(s) did not consent to share their data
 	* shared - The participant(s) consented to share their data with the Databrary community
 	* excerpts - The participant(s) consented to have their data be shared with the Databrary community and excerpts shown to the public.
 	* public - The participant(s) consented to have their data shared with the world at large
 	* no consent information - This is the default if no consent level information is provided
 
### exclusions
* Was this session excluded from the final study? Why? If there is no exclusion information, we default to not excluded.
	* not excluded – the participant’s session was used in the final study
	* pilot – preliminary data prior to settling on a standard method   
	* 	inclusion criteria – participant did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the study but some data were collected nonetheless
	* 	procedural - experimenter error/equipment failure
	* 	withdrew – child became fussy, tired, or withdrew from session for other participant-related reasons
	* 	outlier – participant’s session was unusual compared to the rest of the sessions
	* •	other - please define
	
### setting
 * In what kind of environment did the session take place? 
  * lab
  * home
  * museum
  * classroom
  * outdoor
  * clinic
  * other - please define

### country
* In what country did the session take place?

### state
* In what state did the session take place? 

### conditions 
 * Conditions are levels, tasks, or interventions manipulated or designed by the researcher. If the dataset has between-subject conditions that hold for the entire dataset (e.g., training/control, left/right) then put a descriptive label in the condition column.
 
### group
* Groups are relatively permanent characteristics of the participant. If the dataset has between-subject groups that hold for the entire dataset (e.g., crawler/walker; no-words/1st-words), then put a descriptive label in the group column unless that information is already represented (e.g., boy/girl; typical-development/autism, high-SES/low-SES).
	
### study language
* In what language was the study conducted? 
  

### Information About The Participant
A participant refers to a single person contributing data to a single dataset. Participants can be in multiple sessions (longitudinal datasets). But if the participant is in a different dataset, then he/she should be identified with a new participant id associated with that dataset.

See the participant tab on the Excel spreadsheet. Each row represents a single participant within a single dataset. Information for the columns marked in red comes from the predefined tab.
### birthday - must have 
 * YYYY/MM/DD
 
### gender 
 * male
 * female
 
### race
 * White
 * Asian
 * Black
 * Multiple
 * Pacific Islander
 * Native American
 
 
### ethnicity
 * Not Hispanic or Latino
 * Hispanic or Latino
 
### typical development/disability
 * If there is no information, we will default to typical development
  * typical 
  * disability. Please define.
 
### ses
 * High
 * Medium
 * Low
 * Unknown
 
### primary language
 * What is the participant’s primary language?

### secondary language
* What is the participant’s secondary language if any?
 
### term (gestation) for infants
 * Numeric in weeks from last menstrual period
 
### experience with target behavior 
 * onset date in YYYY-MM-DD
